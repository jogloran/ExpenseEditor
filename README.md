ExpenseEditor
=============

A Core Data/Storyboard demo app: insert expenses and export to CSV.

This was a very simple app built to address a specific data entry need, as quickly as possible. "Rough around the edges" would be an understatement.

It's a simple Master-Detail app built with Storyboards and Core Data, and could serve as a template for such.

What it does
============
- Enter records of the form (Vendor name, vendor suburb, date, payment method, price)
- Add and remove payment methods
- View vendors in descending order of number of records
- Sends data as CSV by e-mail
